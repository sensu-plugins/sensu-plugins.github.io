If you have a new plugin or handler, send a pull request! Don't be afraid on pushing your PR with non-ruby code. Just let someone from [team](https://github.com/sensu?tab=members) know. Maybe we can help you to rewrite your check to Ruby or even invent something completely new to test your work. Just don't hesitate to contact us.


The easiest way to work with the repos is to clone [GIR](https://github.com/sensu-plugins/GIR).  GIR is designed as a framework of rake tasks to help developers work with the various repos individually and as a whole.  To see what tasks are available use `rake -T` to see what repos are available to work with use `rake github:list_repos`.  This should get you started, if you have any questions or want additional functionally open and [issue](https://github.com/sensu-plugins/GIR/issues) or submit a PR.
