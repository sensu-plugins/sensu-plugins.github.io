      <p>Here you will find example plugins, handlers and additional code to maximize the effective use of Sensu in various types of auto-scaling and traditional environments. Most of the code is implemented in Ruby and use the sensu-plugin framework; some also depend on additional gems or packages(e.g. mysql). Some are shell scripts! All languages are welcome but preference is given towards Ruby.
