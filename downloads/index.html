All Sensu-Plugins gems are cryptographically signed. To be sure the gem you install hasn’t been tampered with:

Add the public key (if you haven’t already) as a trusted certificate

{% highlight bash %}
gem cert --add <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensu-plugins/sensu-plugins.github.io/master/certs/sensu-plugins.pem)
gem install <gem> -P MediumSecurity
{% endhighlight %}

You can also download the key from */certs/* within each repository.
